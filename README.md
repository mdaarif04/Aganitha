Approach to Solve the Exercise
Step 1: Identify a Realistic Problem
Since the task is about solving a realistic problem using Python, here are some possible categories you can choose from:

Data Processing – Analyzing a dataset (CSV, JSON, etc.).
Web Scraping – Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup or Selenium.
API Development – Building a REST API with Flask or FastAPI.
Automation – Automating a daily task using Python scripts.
Machine Learning – Training a basic model on sample data.
Step 2: Use an LLM for Assistance
Since it's mandatory to use LLMs, here’s how you can integrate AI into the problem-solving process:

Ask an LLM to generate sample datasets if needed.
Get suggestions for Python libraries that can be useful.
Use AI to debug your code and improve performance.
Step 3: Solve the Problem with Python
I'll assume a data processing task as an example and implement it:
Problem: Process a CSV file and extract key insights (e.g., total sales per product).
